# Passenger-Satisfaction-Survey-Analysis
This project analyzes a passenger satisfaction survey dataset, focusing on business class passengers. Using Python and pandas, the data is imported, cleaned, and analyzed to uncover trends and insights. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the ability to generate insights from large-scale satisfaction data.

The key tasks include:

Data Import and Profiling: Loading the dataset and reviewing its structure, which contains 104,910 rows and 16 columns of data.

Data Subsetting: Filtering the data to focus solely on business class passengers, creating a subset for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting an initial analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. This involves handling missing values, understanding the distribution of satisfaction ratings, and visualizing key variables.

The goal is to identify factors influencing business class passengers' satisfaction levels and generate actionable insights to enhance customer experience. The project demonstrates data cleaning, subsetting, and basic analysis techniques, making it suitable for anyone interested in working with real-world customer satisfaction data.
